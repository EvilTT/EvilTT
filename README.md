# Hi! I'm Maxim Zavadskiy 👨‍💻

***I am a software engineer, web interface developer. I specialize in the development of large enterprise and commercial platforms in the NodeJS ecosystem. I love rock, volleyball, basketball and animals, well, okay, I love React too, but we don't get along. I also try to keep my GitHub profile up to date, but there is always not enough time. Eh... Someday I will take care of it, but for now you can look at my small home projects and if you want to leave your feedback, appreciate your parents and all the world!***
